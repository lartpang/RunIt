A simple program scheduler for your code on different devices.

Let the machine move!

Putting the machine into sleep is a disrespect for time.

## Usage

> [!note]
>
> 2024-8-14: Now, the config file contains the information of your GPUs and jobs, more details can be found in [config.py](./examples/config.py).

### Dependency

- PyYAML==6.0
- nvidia-ml-py (`pynvml` only for `runit_based_on_detected_memory.py`)

### Scripts

We provides 3 scripts for different ways to run jobs.

- `runit_with_exclusive_gpu.py`: One GPU can only be used by one job at a time.
- `runit_based_on_memory`ï¼šOne GPU can be used by many job at a time based on the memory usage.
- `runit_based_on_detected_memory.py`: Use `pynvml` for detecting the total memory usage of each GPU. *But this may not be suitable for scenarios where the memory used by a running GPU application is unstable.*

## demo

```shell
$ python run_it.py --config ./examples/config.yaml
$ python run_it.py --max-workers 3 --config ./examples/config.yaml
```
